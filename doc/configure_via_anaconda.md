# Configure and Manage Your Environment with Anaconda

Per the Anaconda [docs](http://conda.pydata.org/docs):

> Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system 
for installing multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies and 
switching easily between them. It works on Linux, OS X and Windows, and was created 
for Python programs but can package and distribute any software.

## Overview
Using Anaconda consists of the following:

1. Install [`miniconda`](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) on your computer
2. Create a new `conda` [environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) using this project
3. Each time you wish to work, activate your `conda` environment

---

## Installation

**Download** the version of `miniconda` that matches your system. Make sure you download the version for Python 3.5.

**NOTE**: There have been reports of issues creating an environment using miniconda `v4.3.13`. If it gives you issues try versions `4.3.11` or `4.2.12` from [here](https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/).

**Install** [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) on your machine. Detailed instructions:

- **Linux:** http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#linux-miniconda-install (Linux users please also see [this warning](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Python-StarterKit/blob/master/doc/linux_ros_anaconda_warning.md) about how to resolve potential conflicts between the different Python versions installed via Anaconda and ROS.  
- **Mac:** http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#os-x-miniconda-install (Mac users please see [this thread](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2438) for possible issues with Jupyter if you have recently updated OSX)
- **Windows:** http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#windows-miniconda-install

**Setup** your `RoboND` environment. 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Python-StarterKit.git  
cd RoboND-Python-StarterKit
```

If you are on Windows, **rename**   
`meta_windows_patch.yml` to   
`meta.yml`

**Create** RoboND.  Running this command will create a new `conda` environment that is provisioned with all libraries you need to be successful in this program.  
**NOTE:** if you get an error when you try to run this command that `conda` doesn't exist, try closing and re-opening your terminal window.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
**NOTE:** If the above command fails due to internet issues or timed out HTTP request then remove the partially built environment using the following command (then run the above `create` command again):
```
conda env remove -n RoboND
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
**Verify** that the RoboND environment was created in your environments:

```sh
conda info --envs
```

**Cleanup** downloaded libraries (remove tarballs, zip files, etc):

```sh
conda clean -tp
```

## Using Anaconda

Now that you have created an environment, in order to use it, you will need to activate the environment. This must be done **each** time you begin a new working session i.e. open a new terminal window. 

**Activate** the `RoboND` environment:

### OS X and Linux
```sh
$ source activate RoboND
```

### Windows
Depending on shell either:
```sh
$ source activate RoboND
```
or

```sh
$ activate RoboND
```

That's it. Now all of the `RoboND` libraries are available to you.

### However, If you are a Linux user with ROS installed (or planning to install ROS natively on your system) please see [this warning](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Python-StarterKit/blob/master/doc/linux_ros_anaconda_warning.md) about how to resolve potential conflicts between the different Python versions installed via Anaconda and ROS.  
To exit the environment when you have completed your work session, simply close the terminal window.

### Uninstalling
If you ever want to delete or remove an environment 

To **delete/remove** the "RoboND" environment:
```
conda env remove -n RoboND
```

---

### A tip for Linux Users!
Instead of always writing:

```sh
// activation
$ source activate RoboND

//deactivation
$ source deactivate
```

You can navigate to home directory in shell using:

```sh
$ cd
```

Then use an editor to add an `alias` to the `.bashrc` file and shorten the activation line to whatever you want.
For example:

```sh
$ sudo nano .bashrc

  ~ navigate with arrow keys all the way to bottom of the file and type:
  
> # my aliases
> alias robond='source activate RoboND'
> alias killconda='source deactivate'
  
  ~ use `CTRL + X` followed by 'y' to save and exit. Restart the terminal to use the changes.
  
```
now to activate and deactivate all you need to write are:

```sh
// Activate
$ robond

// Deactivate
$ killconda
```
